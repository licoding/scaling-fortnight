### Reflection on HTML and CSS

I am handling HTML and CSS, although sometimes I wonder if I am memorizing HTML and CSS to the best of my capacity. I did the CodeAcademy tutorial, which I generally understood (incidentally I'm remembering that I forgot to screenshot my progress way back when, I should upload that...) I think the practical work of website mastery and playing with the HTML/CSS codes of the provided layouts will be really good for my sense of hands-on learning; I suppose time and output will speak to my progress more than my pottentially self-conscious reflections. At least I have lots of excellent resume spam for the website, and I think I may upload a gallery of photos I snapped during my study abroad to exhibit my skill in that department. Hopefully, my website will complement my resume material and images in an interesting, well organized series of subsections.
