###Digital Humanities Project Review: [Mapping Metaphor](http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/)

The website Mapping Metaphor, hosted by the University of Glasgow, presents a visual web “for all metaphorical links that have been identified between different areas of meaning” in English. Published in 2015, the information provided onsite depicts the history of lexical connections developed in English over time. Based on class criteria of a useful Digital Humanities project, the Mapping Metaphor project appears successful. The website coneveys the purpose of content clearly, and the website admirably presents two different modes for conveying information, useful for both casual and long-term research. Evidence of collaboration is present throughout. This collaboration also underscores the nature of the Mapping Metaphor project as a tool produced from a different 'origin' project, the Historical Thesaurus of English. 

##A BASIS FOR EXISTENCE##

The project helpfully depicts the history of the metaphor in English, and how readers came to acknowledge the ‘metaphor’ as something more distinctive than a simple comparison, such as “‘Juliet is the sun’ [ala Shakespeare]” (Mapping Metaphor). Instead, Mapping Metaphor argues that “metaphor is fundamental to the ways in which we conceptualize and articulate even basic concepts.” However, this meaning does not capture the definition of a metaphor in its fullest complexity. In another Digital Humanities essay analyzing the value of the Mapping Metaphor project, Marc Alexander and Ellen Bramwell define “the aim of the project [is] to discover (or, metaphorically, to ‘map’) those domains of meaning which are used to talk about other domains of meaning” (University of Sheffield). Alexander and Bramwell point out that different kinds of metaphors apart from this stated definition exist, such as ‘metonymy,’ which is a metaphor that, according to Webster’s English dictionary, substitutes a part for a whole, such as a ‘suit’ for a ‘business executive’ in the phrase: ‘look at all those suits.’ Mapping Metaphor partially deals with these more complicated associations, however, Alexander and Bramwell suggest that in order to fully capture the meaning of a certain term, “one might “[wish to index] … non-metaphorical links between concepts alongside the metaphorical work.”
 
 The Mapping Metaphor project fundamentally argues that phrases like ‘waves of immigrants’ or ‘crushing headaches’ surfaced as a consequence of lexical changes over time. So, Mapping Metaphor exists to make apparent these historical shifts in our metaphor use. A user would have a difficult time arguing with this notion on the basis of the website’s clearly presented research, centered around several years of dictionary and linguistic studies. A user might appreciate how the ‘thesis’ of Mapping Metaphor isn’t lengthy onsite, as Mapping Metaphor only presents its justification over a couple paragraphs. Mapping Metaphor also provides linguistic scholarship in a suggested title Metaphors We Live By (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) as an academic complement of its engagement with language. Mapping Metaphor assumes that its users will have a specific goal when using Mapping Metaphor, and does not provide very intimate suggestions for the tool’s use apart from a ‘How to Use’ guide that mainly deals with mechanics of operation ahead of concept suggestions. In short, Mapping Metaphor depends on an independent researcher’s competence for its use. A subsequent informational page linked in the ‘About’ section’, however, provides a list of academic writings published about Mapping Metaphor, where other scholars describe the ways in which it can be used. I personally accessed the Alexander and Bramwell review from Mapping Metaphor’s website, for instance. Novice scholars may wish to use this section as a jumping-point for analyzing Mapping Metaphor in an academic lens.

##DESIGN, TECHNIQUE AND DATA USAGE##

The website’s data is sufficiently enriched by what was apparently a lengthy research engagement after the creation of a Historical Thesaurus in English in 2009. Interested users can access the methodology of the Mapping Metaphor project under an ‘About the Project’ tag, which users conveniently access at the top of the page. The ‘About’ tag isn’t the homepage of the website; from the moment a user enters the Mapping Metaphor’s URL, the Mapping Metaphor tool’s available on the very front of the page. This suggests that the project invites casual users who may use the tool only once out of personal curiosity, while researchers and digital humanists are meant to explore deeper parts of the website if they are interested in using the tool for a particular purpose.  Other important tags include a search/browse function, which I will discuss shortly, a ‘how to guide’ that presents instructions on operating the website in video and text, a definition of metaphor, an about section, and a further links page. This information’s presented in large text on a pleasant green and grey background, by and large accessible as long as users are fluent in English.  

The front page of the website presents a virtual sphere, with long lines wound around it. These links articulate connections between mental, material, and social concepts in language, as suggested by a key. Users can click a link in order to peruse, say, the history of metaphorical connection between ‘Health and Disease’ and ‘Emotion.’ A further investigation of these connections provides information about more specific concepts, such as ‘Health and Jealousy’ in words like ‘heartburn’ or ‘jaundice.’ There are additional categories for the user’s informational interests, such as a suggested timeline for the word’s first emergence, and options that show ‘strong’ metaphorical connections, ‘weak’ metaphorical connections, or both at once. The qualifications that make a metaphorical connection strong or weak are unclear; a researcher must simply accept the word of Mapping Metaphor. 

When clicking a connection, a user can see where the connection first appeared in an approximate timeline on the development of the English language. However, a user cannot immediately see supporting information for these historical claims. Furthermore, while these connections are supported by stated examples, the project links to the Historical Thesaurus in English for more in-depth explanations of lexical definitions. So, the Mapping Metaphor project cannot exist without this pre-established work, which requires offsite travel. A site reform may combine definitions provided by the Historical Thesaurus in English and Mapping Metaphor in order to maximize the usefulness of Mapping Metaphor as an independent entity.

The design of the website also makes available a list format for drawing connections between words and metaphors. If a researcher has trouble navigating the virtual sphere, the list based system, which generates a table of categorical connections between words and underlying metaphors, has a more practical benefit. While the virtual sphere is aesthetically pleasing, lined connections are drawn over other lined connections, making it difficult to explore specific terms. The list-based browsing option is probably the purview of a researcher who would use Mapping Metaphor more than once in their research or studies of English. 

##EVIDENCE OF COLLABORATION##

As implied above, collaboration between different researchers was necessary for the project’s basic implementation. The designers of Mapping Metaphor at the University of Glasgow worked with the writers of the Historical Thesaurus in English, which was published in 2009 by Oxford University. All these bodies are given due credit in the ‘About’ section. The creators of Mapping Metaphor also include a blog that observes the impact of the project and charts its work from the perspective of multiple editors through the project’s initial culmination. While updates over the last year are scarce, at the time of the project’s initial development, it appeared to have an impact on the project’s research and methodology as something that evolved through time. The project also assigns due credit to certain organizations that financially assisted the researchers of the Mapping Metaphor project. Every team member is named, though their specific roles are unclear. Collaborators also published a link that acknowledges helpful research and similar projects in the ‘Links’ category, inclusive of one particularly interesting project called ‘Metaphor in end-of-life-care’ (MELC). A 'Methods' page briefly describes the means of accumulating information; again, specific researchers are not attributed.

##CONCLUSION##

While there’s room for development at hand, Mapping Metaphor provides a well-researched option for understanding uses of metaphor in English. Users of the website will certainly obtain an increased knowledge of lexical origin by manipulating the Mapping Metaphor tool. However, sophisticated scholars may long for more precise historical and metaphorical justification in the information Mapping Metaphor provides. While a 'Methods' page exists, the problems of specificity highlighted in my analysis at least merits an eyebrow raise or project expansion.
